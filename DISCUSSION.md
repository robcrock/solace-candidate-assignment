I had a great time with this challenge. I probably spent too much time on it, but I want to make sure to now only work on the frontend, but also work on the server as well.

The server-side work that was done, while not a perfect UX, would allow the table to scale. That being said, we could probably get quite far with the client-side table.

If I had more time I would have worked on adding filters directly to the column rather than the row of filters I place along the top. I did that to just create something simple that works.

I would also like to work in the design of the specialties and the potentially how filtering could be addressed there. I avoided working on the specialties column too much given the other improvements needed.

The last thing that comes to mind right now would be resolve that flash we get when initially paging from one page to the next. That isn't the experience I would like to deliver, so I would love to resolve that issue.

Thank you for the opportunity!
